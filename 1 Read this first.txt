This repository contains:

The master dataset
data visualizations saved as images
the dofile used to create (most of) the visuals
excel files with more visuals

Note:
1) We ran out of time with RAFIT, but there are some summary visualizations in most of the sheets in the excel file
2) More visuals and statistical tests are in the dofile--they're designed to be quick and informative, not really polished
